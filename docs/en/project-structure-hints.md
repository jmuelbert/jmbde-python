# Project Structure Improvements

## 1. General Suggestions

### Remove Redundant Files

Files like .DS_Store can be removed as they don't serve a purpose in version control. Ensure .gitignore has entries to prevent reintroduction. Document Structure: Add a docs/structure.md or similar file explaining the purpose of various folders and key
files for new contributors. Consolidate Configuration Files: If possible, reduce the number of configuration files by merging compatible ones. For instance, tools like prettier and eslint allow combining their configurations into package.json or
.pyproject.toml. Review Obsolete Files: Check for unused or outdated configurations like .gitlab-ci.yml if GitHub Actions is the primary CI/CD.

## 2. CI/CD Improvements

### Centralize GitHub Actions Workflows

Consider consolidating workflows by combining related actions (e.g., linting and testing) into fewer files for better readability and management.

### Auto-Generate Release Notes

The release-drafter.yml is a great start; integrate it with workflows to auto-generate draft releases after merges.

### Secrets Management

If using .envrc or .secretlintrc.json, ensure sensitive data is securely encrypted and managed using GitHub Secrets or a secrets management tool like HashiCorp Vault.

## 3. Documentation

### Add More High-Level Docs

Expand README.md or add files to explain: System architecture or design principles. How the documentation is generated (mkdocs setup). How to extend linters like Vale and Proselint. Enhance MkDocs Structure: Add custom navigation for better
discoverability in mkdocs.yml.

### API Documentation

If api-docs.md is auto-generated, integrate the generation process into CI/CD. 4. Linting and Static Analysis

### MegaLinter Logs

Review recurring errors (e.g., ERROR-REPOSITORY_GITLEAKS.log) and suppress false positives or fix underlying issues.

### Dynamic Linters Configuration

Move .cspell.json or goodcheck.yml under a common config/linters/ directory for better organization.

### Custom Dictionaries

If config/vocabularies/ contains common terms, share them with contributors to reduce inconsistencies.

## 5. Resources

### Optimize Icons

Simplify folder structures for icons (tango, Vimix-Paper) and document their purpose.

### Use a CDN or Assets Manager

Instead of bundling large resource directories like resources/icons, consider hosting on a CDN or packaging them separately.

## 6. Code Quality

### Dependency Management

pyproject.toml and package.json should ensure all dependencies are pinned to avoid version conflicts.

### Consolidate Wheels and Tarballs

The dist/ folder should be cleaned regularly and excluded from version control.

### Test Coverage

Enhance .coverage usage with automatic uploads to a service like Codecov for better visibility.

## 7. Security

### Reuse Compliance

Ensure REUSE.toml is up-to-date and aligns with LICENSES/. Regular Security Scans: Use workflows like gitleaks, checkov, and grype to automate scanning.

### Secrets Audit

Ensure .envrc doesn't contain sensitive keys directly.

## 8. Contributor Friendliness

### Streamline Onboarding

Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md and community/ to include setup scripts, quick start guides, and FAQs.

### Standardize Commit Messages

Leverage commitlint.config.js and CI to enforce a consistent style.

### Code Style Guides

Ensure .editorconfig and .prettierrc.yaml reflect the same style guides.
Here's how to optimize and reduce the complexity of your project structure:

1. **Remove Generated/Cache Files**:

```plaintext
- Remove all __pycache__ directories
- Remove .DS_Store
- Remove .coverage and coverage.xml
- Remove dist/ directory contents
- Remove site/ directory (generated docs)
- Remove .ropeproject
```

2. **Consolidate Config Files**:

```plaintext
.github/
  config/           # Move all config files here
    linting/        # All linter configs
    words/          # All word lists
    workflows/      # GitHub Actions configs
```

3. **Optimize Documentation Structure**:

```plaintext
docs/
  _assets/         # All doc assets
  _templates/      # Doc templates
  api/            # API docs
  guides/         # User guides
  i18n/           # Translations
    de/
    es/
    it/
  reference/      # Technical reference
```

4. **Organize Assets**:

```plaintext
assets/
  icons/          # Combine all icons under size directories
    16x16/
    22x22/
    32x32/
    scalable/
  images/         # App images
  styles/         # QSS files
  translations/   # Translation files
  ui/            # UI files
```

5. **Simplify Root Directory**:
   Keep only essential files:

```plaintext
├── .devcontainer/          # Dev container config
├── .github/                # GitHub specific files
├── .vscode/               # VS Code settings
├── assets/                # Project assets
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── src/                   # Source code
├── tests/                 # Test files
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml         # Project configuration
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .gitignore
└── .editorconfig
```

6. **Merge Configuration Files**:

```toml
# pyproject.toml - Centralize configuration
[tool.black]
[tool.ruff]
[tool.mypy]
[tool.pytest]
[tool.coverage]
[tool.isort]
[tool.codespell]
```

Files to remove:

```plaintext
- .gitlab-ci.yml (if not using GitLab)
- .prettierignore (use .gitignore)
- .prettierrc.yaml (config in pre-commit)
- .markdown-link-check.json (move to .github/config)
- .markdownlint.json (move to .github/config)
- Various duplicate config files
```

Updated structure:

```plaintext
jmbde-python/
├── .devcontainer/          # Development container config
├── .github/                # GitHub specific files and workflows
│   ├── config/            # All configurations
│   ├── workflows/         # GitHub Actions
│   └── CODEOWNERS        # Ownership definition
├── .vscode/               # VS Code settings
├── assets/                # Project assets (organized)
├── docs/                  # Documentation (simplified)
├── src/                   # Source code
│   └── jmbde/            # Main package
├── tests/                # Test files (organized)
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml        # Central configuration
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .gitignore
└── .editorconfig
```

Would you like me to:

1. Show how to migrate specific configurations?
2. Create a migration script?
3. Provide more detailed organization for specific directories?
4. Show how to handle the transition?
