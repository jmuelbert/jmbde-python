# Branches

## main
Purpose: This is your production-ready branch. It should always contain stable code that is ready for deployment.
Usage: Only merge into this branch when you are confident that the code is stable and ready for release.

## develop
Purpose: This branch is for ongoing development. It serves as the integration branch for features and fixes.
Usage: Merge feature branches into this branch when they are complete and tested.

## feat/#
Purpose: Use this branch for developing new features. You can create a separate branch for each feature you are working on.
Usage: Name your branches like feat/my-new-feature. Once the feature is complete, merge it into the develop branch.

## fix/
Purpose: This branch is for bug fixes, especially if you need to address issues quickly.
Usage: Name your branches like fix/urgent-bug. Merge these into both main (if itâ€™s a critical fix) and develop.

## Optional Branches

### release/
Purpose: If you want to prepare for a new version release, you can create a release branch. This is optional for solo developers but can be useful if you want to stabilize your code before merging into main.
Usage: Name your branches like release/v1.0. Once everything is finalized, merge it into main and tag the release.

## Environment Setup

## Development Environment:
__Branches:__ ``` develop, feat/**, fix/** ```
Usage: This is where you actively develop and test new features and fixes.

## Staging Environment (optional):
__Branches:__ ```release/**, develop```
Usage: If you choose to have a staging environment, this is where you can test your code before it goes to production.

## Production Environment:
__Branches:__ main
Usage: This is your live environment. Only deploy code from the main branch.

## Future-Proofing
 Version Control: By using a structured branching strategy, you can easily manage new features, bug fixes, and releases. This will help you maintain a clean project history and make it easier to roll back changes if needed.
Collaboration: If you ever decide to collaborate with others or open-source your project, having a clear branching strategy will make it easier for others to understand your workflow.
Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): If you plan to implement CI/CD in the future, having a well-defined branching strategy will help you set up automated testing and deployment processes.
Conclusion
This branching strategy is simple enough for a solo developer while still being robust enough to accommodate future growth. It allows you to keep your work organized and prepares you for potential collaboration or more complex project management down the line. As you grow more comfortable with Git and your project evolves, you can always adjust your strategy to fit your needs.
